# Manual:
I have created a Gradle Project.
Extract the freetts-1.2.2-bin.zip folder.
Then, go to \freetts-1.2.2-bin\freetts-1.2\lib
Run the jsapi.exe file, this will create the jsapi.jar file.

We need these dependencies from \freetts-1.2.2-bin\freetts-1.2\lib :
cmu_us_kal.jar
freetts-jsapi10.jar
jsapi.jar

We need two more dependencies and download them from "https://github.com/goxr3plus/Java-Speech-Recognizer-Tutorial--Calculator/tree/master/!!Libraries%20for%20all%20the%20tutorials!!!":
sphinx4-core-5prealpha-20160628.232526-10.jar
sphinx4-data-5prealpha-20160628.232535-10.jar

Make sure these dependencies are added to the project before running the code.

Download the sphinx4-5prealpha-src folder from https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/sphinx4/5prealpha/

I have put the list of commands in \BanglishSiri\src\main\resources called commands.txt
About 1/3rd of it is English, 1/3rd is Bangla, and 1/3rd is Banglish.
You can try these commands and they should run the code.
Closing the pop-up window will also close the program.
If there are any issues, please email me at mdnhossain11@gmail.com
